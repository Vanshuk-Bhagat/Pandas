# Pandas
This repository contains several Pandas data files used for data manipulation and analysis tasks. The files include datasets for various projects involving data aggregation, filtering, and summary statistics. These files are formatted for use with Pandas, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets and streamlined data analysis workflows.

Pandas Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the **Pandas Data Analysis** repository! This repository contains multiple datasets and Python scripts designed to perform various data manipulation and analysis tasks using the powerful **Pandas** library.

Contents
Data Files: A collection of CSV files containing structured data used for analysis.  
Python Scripts: Scripts leveraging Pandas to perform summing values across rows and columns, filtering data based on specific conditions, calculating summary statistics like mean, sum, and count, and grouping data by categories for deeper analysis.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the code and datasets in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/Vanshuk-Bhagat/Pandas.git


2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   Make sure you have Pandas installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:
   bash
   pip install pandas
   

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts:  
   Analyze the data using the provided Python scripts. Each script demonstrates different aspects of data manipulation, such as aggregation, filtering, and grouping.

How to Use
Modify the scripts: You can adjust the scripts to fit your own analysis needs. For example, you can change filtering criteria, apply additional data transformations, or calculate new statistics.  
Run the scripts: Open the Python files or Jupyter notebooks in your preferred IDE, and run them to see how the datasets are processed and analyzed.
